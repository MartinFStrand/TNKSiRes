mRNASeq-DEG-Vulcanoplots - script and files for generating vulcanoplots of DEGs from the mRNASeq NOISeq analysis for 5 cancer cell lines
mRNA-PCA-analysis - script and files for generating PCA-plot of mRNASEq expression data for 5 cancer cell lines
mutation-Waterfallplot - script and files for generating a waterfall plot of mutation data from databases for the 5 cell lines
SILAC-NOISeq-Vulcanoplots - script and files for NOISeq analysis of SILAC data and generation of vulcanoplots
SILAC-NOISeq-DEG-Heatmap - script and files for generating heatmaps for NOISeq DEG's for the SILAC proteomics data
